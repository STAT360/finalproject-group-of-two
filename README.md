# finalproject

Please write your initial proposal for your final project in this README document. What type of project is it? 

- Package?
    - data package
    - analysis package
- Shiny app? 
- Something else?

Where do you expect to find data? Do you need help finding data? What question will your project answer or purpose will it solve?

# Proposal

We will be creating a Shiny App for our final project. We found a data set about wine reviews on a website called "Kaggle" (linked below). It holds variables like the origin location, type, description, etc. The goal is that this data would make a creative and visually appealing app that is easily able to manipulate through the user interface. We are hoping to highlight fun details like the prevalence of certain descriptive words, popular areas highly rated wines are from, etc. Hopefully we can uncover some interesting trends and profiles about wine that may not be transparent without this analysis.
