# finalproject

Please write your initial proposal for your final project in this README document. What type of project is it? 

- Package?
    - data package
    - analysis package
- Shiny app? 
- Something else?

Where do you expect to find data? Do you need help finding data? What question will your project answer or purpose will it solve?

# Proposal

We will be creating a Shiny App for our final project. We found a data set in GitHub called "artsmia/collection" and it contains data on the art collections in the Minneapolis Institute of Art. The goal is that this data would make a creative and visually appealing app. We just need to make sure it's in a format R can use. We are hoping to highlight details about art at the MIA based on location of origin, time, type, and cost of these artworks. Hopefully we can uncover some interesting trends and history of art that may not be transparent without this analysis.
